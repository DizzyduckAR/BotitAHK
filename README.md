Everything is open!
all the code. all the core files are uncompiled. you can view change and add anything you like. no one is stopping ya..

some data before we start:
Botit runs on 5mb per bot. it auto support multi procs.
botit do not use mouse or keyboard. user can fully use the pc.
Botit do not use screen. you can fully turn off your screen we snap the target window to memory no screen use.
Window pos is not relavent you can free move the window botit will track the pos by title.
Window not on front? no issue! you can stack few window's and run them all we dont use mouse and screen so the bot only talk to the target window.

**window size is an issue. we cover this user error with "auto crop" on image tool. it will auto set the target window to the setting developer set on the bot build.
  so even if you lost your window size you can auto fix it by running auto crop.
