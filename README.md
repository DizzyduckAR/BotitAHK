Botit AHK is full gui Automation tool.
holding a powerful and tiny image and pixel scanner with full background window screenshot support.
Self and auto calculation of any matched image with easy and clear control for each image and mode.

Botit ahk allow the user to build fully working bots without the need to understand code.
botit comes with:

Botit - Main automation tool with gui and self settings.
Botit Image tool - a super auto image tool allow user to crop / change / test detect / test click / auto crop / change scan area and much more..
Botit Manager - Allow user to add flows to botit. add images and functions to the flows and fully control the settings of everything on the bot. 
                manager also allow self publish with developer data per bots.


Everything is open!
all the code. all the core files are uncompiled. you can view change and add anything you like. no one is stopping ya..

some data before we start:
Botit runs on 5mb per bot. it auto support multi procs.
botit do not use mouse or keyboard. user can fully use the pc.
Botit do not use screen. you can fully turn off your screen we snap the target window to memory no screen use.
Window pos is not relavent you can free move the window botit will track the pos by title.
Window not on front? no issue! you can stack few window's and run them all we dont use mouse and screen so the bot only talk to the target window.

**window size is an issue. we cover this user error with "auto crop" on image tool. it will auto set the target window to the setting developer set on the bot build.
  so even if you lost your window size you can auto fix it by running auto crop.


So let say you are a new user with 0 understanding in code. where do you start??

1) download Botit Blank zip file or clone the repo
2) no install is needed. we run on stock autohotkey exe with uncompiled code. if you click on exe file it will run the script with the same name.
3) we start with Botit Manager.exe (it will allow us to add scan flows and images) * if you install ahk on the system you can run the .ahk file no need *.exe

Side menu hold data of the image correctly holding(if no image cropped yet it will show no image)
Tol = how far the user image match vs the target. range is from 0-125 golden area is 40-75. each image need TOl or match will fail!
Scan mode = allow user to pick how he wanna match the image. to the all window or just to the area image was cropped on. (botit will auto make the cords when you snap the    image)
Scan Color = how you wanna match the image. Color will use full color (faster but less accurate timer- 0.018 / grayscale is a bit slower but very accurate timer- 0.024)
Clicks = click or no click command
demo = user screen area with the target area. used by image tool to point you on what you snapped (it will auto build the demo and path when you crop)
area scan = allow you to re take the area of the image if you wanna make the area bigger or smaller.

Dont forget to save per each object.
**Any image you add will need tol to be set. it will not work if you dont save tol per the image.

after we added flow and images to our botit manager and saved our image scan data we can now start botit and use the image tool. (for testing and hot reload)
when we open botit blank
